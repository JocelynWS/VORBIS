# Audio Codec Project â€“ Vorbis Compression ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ¶

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Description

This project is developed as part of a course assignment on audio processing and codec evaluation. Our team selected the **Vorbis** codec to complete the given tasks, including recording, spectrum analysis, compression, and sound mixing.

## ðŸ“‹ Tasks Completed

1. **Audio Recording**  
   - A 3â€“4 minute voice recording where each member:
     - States their full name and student ID
     - Describes their assigned tasks and contributions

2. **Spectrum Analysis using MATLAB**  
   - The recorded audio waveform was analyzed in MATLAB.
   - A frequency spectrum was plotted to observe the energy distribution.
   - Comments were made regarding the energy spread across frequency components.

3. **Audio Compression (Vorbis)**  
   - A custom compression program was written using the Vorbis codec.
   - The recorded audio was compressed and output in `.ogg` format.

4. **Quality Comparison with MP3**  
   - The same audio was also compressed using MP3 format.
   - PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) was calculated to compare quality.
   - Comparative results were presented.

5. **MIDI Music Generation & Mixing**  
   - A MIDI music track with the same duration as the original recording was created.
   - The MIDI and voice audio were mixed to create a **Jazz-style song**.
